************About Code Files***************

The preprocessing.ipynb does the preprocessing wherin it converts the video to image frames and also crops the images and stores it in contant and non contact folder

The svm and svm_gamma_combination2 files contain the svm codes and predicts whether or not there is a contact according to input

The player_detection_using_mmdetection jupyter notebook file contains our second research question of whether the state of the art object detection models perform better on cropped images or not

The resnet50_no_augmentation contains the training and prediction by it for contact between players. The remaining file contact_detection_models contains efficientnet model results and we overwrote the models output
